 *     to a controller which will access the media contained. With that in mind, one
 *     of the main functions of this class is not only to request the URI, but specifically
 *     the node that contains the data needed. There is no ambiguity, this class serves
 *     one purpose and one purpose only: To request and process the contents of a URI.
